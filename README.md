# josm-visualize-routes
JOSM Plugin to visualize routes

This plugin adds tabs to the relation editor that make editing routes easier.

It allows opening a GTFS file as separate layer


## Development

You need to have Java installed and I recommend Linux (but it works on Windows, too).

To run the current development version of the plugin, clone the project locally and then run: `./gradlew runBoot`

## Development in IntelliJ

Start IntelliJ (Community Edition or Ultimate)

It will allow you to check out a Project using Git. If you don't find this option, use `Git` â†’ `Clone` in the main menu.

You can use this URL:
```
https://github.com/michaelzangl/josm-visualize-routes.git
```

After IntelliJ has started, you can press `Ctrl` twice, it will open a run prompt. Search for `runJosm` and run that task.
